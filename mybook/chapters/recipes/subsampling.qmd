# Subsampling FASTQ files

Level: beginner+

In [Using wildcards to generalize your rules](../beginner+/wildcards.qmd),
we introduced the use of wildcards to generate 

```python
rule all:
    input:
        "big.subset100.fastq"

rule subset:
    input:
        "big.fastq"
    output:
        "big.subset{num_lines}.fastq"
    shell: """
        head -{wildcards.num_lines} {input} > {output}
    """

```

## Subsampling records rather than lines

Here, one potential problem is that we are producing subset files
based on the number of lines, not the number of records - typically,
in FASTQ files, four lines make a record. Ideally, the subset FASTQ file
produced by the recipe above would have the number of _records_ in its
filename, rather than the number of lines! However, this requires
multiplying the number of records by 4!

You can do this using [`params:` functions](./params-functions.qmd),
which let you introduce Python functions into your rules.
